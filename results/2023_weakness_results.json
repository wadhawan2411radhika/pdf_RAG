    "Overall Bank and Group Materiality $635 million (2022: $675 million) How we determined it Approximately 5% of 2023 financial year net profit before income tax (PBT) for the Bank (2022: approximately 5% of 2022 financial year net PBT for the Group). As the Bank has a lower PBT in the year ended 30 June 2023, we calculated materiality based on the Bank PBT and applied this during the audit of both the Bank and the Group.\nRationale for the materiality benchmark applied We applied this threshold, together with qualitative considerations, to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial report as a whole.\nWe chose PBT because, in our view, it is the metric against which the performance of the Bank and the Group is most commonly measured and is a generally accepted benchmark.\nWe performed our audit over both the Bank and the Group financial information concurrently.\nWe applied the lower materiality calculated based on the Bank PBT in order to avoid duplication of work.\nWe utilised a 5% threshold based on our professional judgement, noting that it is within the range of commonly acceptable thresholds.\nKey audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the current year. We describe each key audit matter and include a summary of the principal audit procedures we performed to address those matters in the table below.\nThe key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context. The key audit matters identified below relate to both the Bank and the Group audit, unless otherwise stated below. We communicated the key audit matters to the Audit Committee.\n268 Independent auditor\u2019s report (continued) Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Provisions for loan impairment AASB 9 Financial Instruments requires the recognition of a Provision for Expected Credit Losses (ECL) against the gross carrying value of the Bank\u2019s and the Group\u2019s loans and other receivables, the measurement of which is required to incorporate reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\nThe Bank and the Group utilise complex models to calculate ECL on a collective basis. These models have been developed using internal historical default data and incorporate various forward-looking assumptions, such as forecasts of future economic conditions across multiple economic scenarios.\nIndividually assessed provisions are also recognised by the Bank and the Group for loans and other receivables that are known to be impaired at the reporting date.",
